//! Skin manifest parsing: the frontend-neutral half of the skin system.
//!
//! A skin is a directory under `~/.vellum-fe/global/skins/<name>/` containing a
//! `skin.toml` manifest plus image assets. This module owns the manifest
//! format, loading, and the canonical injury doll part table; textures,
//! painting, and the calibrator's comment-preserving save live in
//! `frontend/gui/skin.rs`. The split matters because the web frontend
//! serves skin data too and compiles without the `gui` feature (the
//! mobile builds).
//!
//! Manifest format:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [meta]
//! name = "Parchment"
//! description = "Warm paper backgrounds for text windows"
//!
//! # Applies to every window without its own [window.<name>] entry.
//! [window.default.background]
//! image = "bg/paper.png"   # relative to the skin directory (absolute paths allowed)
//! fit = "cover"            # stretch | cover | contain | tile | center
//! opacity = 0.85           # 0.0..=1.0
//! tint = "#c0a878"         # optional multiply tint
//! scrim = 0.3              # 0.0..=1.0 theme-colored overlay for text readability
//!
//! # Windows are matched by their layout window name ("main", "thoughts", ...).
//! [window.main.background]
//! image = "bg/vellum.png"
//! scrim = 0.5
//! ```
//!
//! Image paths are usually relative to the skin directory; absolute paths
//! are allowed on purpose so a skin can reference assets from another
//! install (e.g. a user's local Wrayth art) without copying them.

# A part can instead ship hand-drawn full-canvas overlays per state
# (healthy = uninjured, injury1-3 = wounds, scar1-3 = scars). A part with
# ANY overlay art never draws a generated dot: at a state with no art the
# base shows through. Two authoring schemes both work — a worst-case base
# with transparent holes that overlays paint back toward health (omit a
# state to reveal the hole = severed), or an empty base where every state
# is its own transparent overlay. Parts you leave artless keep their dots.

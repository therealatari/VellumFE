//! The creature-field floor solver, ported from the quad-placement
//! prototype and revised against the field-solver v2 prototype
//! (vellum-field-solver-v2.html). Pure data — no frontend imports, no
//! per-frame work.
//!
//! Contract (the prototype's readouts, promoted to invariants):
//!
//! - **Permanence.** A unit's square and offsets are decided once, on
//!   arrival, and never touched again (Studio `place_at` is the one
//!   explicit override). Arrivals fit themselves around whoever is already
//!   standing; removals free squares. Nothing else mutates placement.
//!   (Screen positions may still shift when the floor grows — that is the
//!   camera re-framing a wider floor, world coordinates unchanged.)
//! - **Separation.** Every unit owns its own screen column: the gap to
//!   any neighbour is at least `sep_frac` × the mean of the two contact
//!   spans (the part of each card that actually rests on the floor — a
//!   tail or a thrown-forward paw overhangs it harmlessly), unless the
//!   room was genuinely full when it arrived (the unit is then marked
//!   `tight`).
//! - **Occlusion cap.** Occlusion is a FEASIBILITY BOUND, not a cost: a
//!   candidate hiding more than `occlusion_cap` of any identity region
//!   (its own or a neighbour's) is rejected outright, and the depth terms
//!   optimise freely inside what remains. Penalising occlusion instead
//!   cannot buy depth — side-by-side cards never overlap, which is exactly
//!   how a cost converges on a straight row.
//! - **Spawn zone.** Feet land inside the ellipse inscribed in the floor's
//!   world extent (shrunk by `zone_inset`); the ellipse supplies the border
//!   the old margin columns used to, so the whole floor gets used.
//! - **Fall envelope.** An arrival reserves room for the pose it is not in
//!   yet: the union of its standing and prone rects must not overlap a
//!   neighbour's envelope past the (relaxable) threshold, because
//!   relocation after the fact is forbidden by permanence.
//! - **Ground-z depth.** Draw order and next/prev targeting sort on the
//!   unit's ground depth, never on a lifted screen position.
//!
//! When the floor hits its column cap the hard rules relax a notch at a
//! time (`relax_steps`) before falling through to the least-bad candidate:
//! loosening in order costs a little overlap; falling through costs a
//! pile-up.
//!
//! The solver works in a fixed VIRTUAL STAGE (880×470, the prototype's
//! canvas). Renderers map virtual→actual rect uniformly; every screen-
//! space relationship the solver guarantees is invariant under that
//! scale, so widget resizes never re-solve anything.

/// Virtual stage the solver measures in. Renderers scale to their rect.
